# Auto-reply-Robot
The auto-reply robot is a web-based interactive dialogue application. 
(It is also a modernized version of "auto-answer robot 1.0")

It can response to clientâ€™s questions in real time. This function is very popular among various websites to provide customers the information they are looking for, in a more efficient and precise way.
 
This application utilized JSP, CSS and JavaScript to create both the dialogue web pages and the database administration pages as the application UI.

The UI layer and domain model layer are incorporated using Java Servlet in Java EE.

In the backend, data Access Objects were created to process CRUD manipulations on the data in MySQL databases
